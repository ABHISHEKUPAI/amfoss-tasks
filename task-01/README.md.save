# Task-01: Terminal Hunt

commands that i felt new personally  :- 
1] The chmod command in Linux (change mode) is used to modify file and directory permissions. It lets you control who can read (r=4), write (w=2), and execute (x=1) files for the user (u), group (g), and others (o). Permissions can be set using numeric (e.g., chmod 755 file) or symbolic notation (e.g., chmod u+x file). Commonly, it’s used to make scripts executable (chmod +x script.sh) or restrict access (chmod 600 file). Options like -R allow recursive permission changes on directories.

2]To change a branch in Git using terminal, first check your current branch with git branch, then fetch the latest branches using git fetch. To switch to an existing branch, use git checkout branch_name (or the newer git switch branch_name), and to create and switch to a new branch, use git checkout -b new_branch (or git switch -c new_branch). If you have uncommitted changes, you must commit or stash them before switching.

3] find . -type f -size +99c -size -100c
meaning 
. → start search in the current directory.
-type f → look only for regular files (not directories).
-size +99c → files larger than 99 bytes.
-size -100c → files smaller than 100 bytes.

4]In Linux (and other Unix-like systems), any file or directory whose name begins with a dot (.) is considered hidden.
