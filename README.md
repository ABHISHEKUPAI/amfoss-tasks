<H2>WHAT MAKES ME SPECIAL?</H2>
I do not consider myself someone with extraordinary inborn abilities—but what makes me special is my curiosity and determination to learn and grow. My goal is not driven by wealth or luxury, but by a genuine desire to make an impact through technology—to create solutions that can reach and uplift people’s lives.
I am a patient and consistent learner, willing to research thoroughly before seeking guidance. I value mentorship, as I believe it can accelerate my growth as a programmer. Inspired by leaders like Sundar Pichai, I strive to improve my problem-solving mindset every day, not only to become a better programmer but also to become someone capable of leading and creating meaningful change.
