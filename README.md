I abelieve i am a patient and consistent learner, willing to research thoroughly before seeking guidance. I value mentorship, as I believe it can accelerate my growth as a programmer. Inspired by leaders like Sundar Pichai, I strive to improve my problem-solving mindset every day, not only to become a better programmer but also to become someone capable of leading and creating meaningful change.

<H2>How do you intend to contribute back to the club?</H2>
I do not consider myself someone with extraordinary inborn abilities—but what makes me special is my curiosity and determination to learn and grow. My goal is a genuine desire to make an impact through technology—to create solutions that can reach and uplift people’s lives.Once i find  my forte in coding  and i really want to explore various fields like Gsoc , i believe my contributions if possible in future in these spheres is a way of me contributinf back to the club. 
<h2>What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?</h2>
to be very honest i really dont have a specefic answer but i really do enjoy coding . what i am planning to do is i first want to find my interest check if its into web dev, app dev , etc i plan to find it by doing projects in eash of the category i will then select that one which i find the most interesting and facenating at the same time .Then i will work on it to be one among the best but at the same time evolving with other fields so that i stay updated .
<h2>What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?</h2>
i did indeed enjoy the process . i had done each task keeping in mind the fact that i could as well as i could not get selected into amfoss. as it was in my mind i focused on learning task and not simply wasting time by simply completing the task one after the another blindly . i do find it sad that i was not able to complete everything but i am confident that i have done whatever i can in the current scenario.
