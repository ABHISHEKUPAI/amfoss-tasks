Task-05 (Time tick quiz)

how i solved this task

i knew python basics but had learned about api html module and threading from th is task .

so first of all i needed to ask user about the difficulty number of question and the type of question and then fetch the data from trivia api 

for this i needed request module , html module to have a proper display of the fetched item from trivia api  

then just absorb results from the data and then i need to put this in front of user 

so i in order to do that i need to either know if its multiple choice or boolean so again ig else comes where if its multiple i needed to select one answer and 3 wrong answers and then shuffle using random module and then display each options and if its Boolean then put true and false and complete the task . 

now i had to take input but at the same time i needed to start and keep the timer running so i need to bring in threading module 

once thats done i just now have to keep the time under 15 sec and get input from the user for each of the answer and checck if its correct or wrong and then finally display score

When you activate venv, your terminal session is modified to use the Python and pip inside the venv/Scripts/ folder.
